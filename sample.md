## Introduction

> "The art of elicitation is not in asking the right questions, but in creating the conditions where the right answers emerge naturally."
> 
> — *Knowledge Engineering Handbook, 2023*

Technical elicitation is the systematic process of extracting domain knowledge from subject matter experts. Whether you're building software systems, documenting processes, or conducting research, effective elicitation separates successful projects from failed ones.

This guide explores proven techniques for **getting to the truth** behind complex technical domains.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Listen More Than You Speak**
The 80/20 rule applies here: spend 80% of your time listening, 20% asking clarifying questions.

### 2. **Follow the Mental Model**
Don't impose your framework—discover theirs. Every expert has an internal logic that governs their decisions.

### 3. **Make the Implicit Explicit**
Experts often skip "obvious" steps that are crucial for understanding. Your job is to surface these hidden assumptions.

## Techniques

### The Walkthrough Method
Ask the expert to demonstrate their process in real-time:

```
"Show me exactly what you do when [specific scenario] happens.
Don't explain it—actually do it while I watch."
```

**Why it works:** Actions reveal details that verbal descriptions miss.

### The Devil's Advocate Approach
Present alternative scenarios to test boundaries:

- "What if the data looks like this instead?"
- "How would you handle it if the system was down?"
- "What's the worst-case scenario you've encountered?"

### The Storytelling Technique
\| Prompt \| Purpose \|
\|--------\|---------\|
\| "Tell me about a time when..." \| Reveals exceptional cases \|
\| "Walk me through your worst day..." \| Uncovers failure modes \|
\| "What's the most interesting problem you've solved?" \| Identifies expertise boundaries \|

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ **The Assumption Trap**
**Problem:** Assuming you understand jargon or abbreviations.
**Solution:** Always ask "What does [term] mean in this context?"

### ❌ **The Leading Question**
**Problem:** "So you probably handle errors by logging them, right?"
**Solution:** "How do you handle errors when they occur?"

### ❌ **The Information Dump**
**Problem:** Asking broad questions that generate overwhelming responses.
**Solution:** Break complex topics into specific, actionable chunks.

## Real-World Examples

### Case Study: Database Migration Process

**Initial Question (Wrong):**
*"How do you migrate databases?"*

**Better Approach:**
1. "Show me the last database migration you performed"
2. "What did you check before starting?"
3. "What could have gone wrong at each step?"
4. "How did you know it was successful?"

**Result:** Discovered 12 validation steps that weren't documented anywhere.

### Case Study: API Design Decisions

**Surface-Level Response:**
*"We follow REST principles and use JSON."*

**Deep Elicitation:**
- **Probe:** "Show me an example of a 'good' API response from your system"
- **Follow-up:** "What makes this response structure better than alternatives?"
- **Edge case:** "What happens when this field is null?"

**Discovery:** Found 3 undocumented business rules embedded in the API design.

## Advanced Techniques

### The Rubber Duck Method (Reversed)
Instead of experts explaining to a rubber duck, **you** explain your understanding back to them:

> "Let me make sure I understand: When X happens, you do Y because Z. Is that right?"

### The Documentation Review
Don't just ask questions—review existing documentation together:
- What's missing?
- What's outdated?
- What assumptions are baked in?

### The Exception Mapping
Create a systematic inventory of "what-if" scenarios:

```markdown
\| Normal Case \| Exception \| Expert Response \|
\|-------------\|-----------\|-----------------\|
\| File uploads successfully \| File is corrupted \| Run validation, quarantine, alert admin \|
\| API returns 200 \| API returns 500 \| Retry 3x, fallback to cache, escalate \|
```

## Checklist for Effective Sessions

- [ ] **Prepare specific scenarios** based on the domain
- [ ] **Bring real examples** of data/problems they work with
- [ ] **Record the session** (with permission) for later analysis
- [ ] **Summarize key points** immediately after the session
- [ ] **Schedule follow-up** to validate your understanding

---

## Tools and Resources

### Documentation Templates
- **Process Flow Template:** Step → Decision → Action → Outcome
- **Exception Matrix:** Normal → Edge Case → Response → Escalation
- **Mental Model Map:** Concept → Relationships → Constraints → Examples

### Useful Phrases
- "Help me understand the reasoning behind..."
- "What would happen if we didn't do [step]?"
- "Are there any unwritten rules I should know about?"
- "What do you wish everyone understood about this process?"
