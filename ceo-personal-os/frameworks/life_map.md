# Life Map Framework

**Based on Alex Lieberman's approach to balancing six life dimensions.**

Most CEOs optimize one or two areas of life (usually work and maybe health) and let the rest drift. The Life Map framework ensures you're intentional across all six dimensions that make up a full life:

1. **Career** — Your work, impact, and professional growth
2. **Relationships** — Your connections with family, partner, and friends
3. **Health** — Your physical and mental well-being
4. **Meaning** — Your sense of purpose, spirituality, or contribution
5. **Finances** — Your financial security and freedom
6. **Fun** — Your joy, play, and experiences outside of productivity

This framework helps you assess where you are in each dimension, where you want to be, and what needs to shift.

## How to Use This Framework

1. Rate yourself (1–10) in each dimension based on your current reality
2. Define what a "10" looks like for you in each area
3. Identify the 1–2 dimensions that need the most attention right now
4. Set specific actions to improve those areas
5. Revisit quarterly to track progress and rebalance

This takes 45–60 minutes. Update it every 3 months.

## Visual Snapshot

Plot your six ratings on a simple chart (you can sketch this by hand or visualize it):

```
Career:        ___/10  ██████████
Relationships: ___/10  ██████████
Health:        ___/10  ██████████
Meaning:       ___/10  ██████████
Finances:      ___/10  ██████████
Fun:           ___/10  ██████████
```

**What do you notice?**
- Which area is the lowest?
- Which area is over-indexed?
- Is your life balanced, or lopsided?

---

## Prioritization

You can't fix everything at once. Pick the 1–2 dimensions that, if improved, would have the biggest impact on your overall well-being.

**My top priority dimension(s) this quarter:**
1. [Dimension]
2. [Dimension]

**Why these?**
[What makes these the most important right now?]

**Specific commitments:**
- [Example: I will work out 3x/week for the next 90 days.]
- [Example: I will have one date night per week with my partner.]
- [Add 2–3 specific, measurable commitments.]

---

## The Balance Question

**Is balance even the goal?**

Not necessarily. Some seasons require focus on one area (e.g., launching a company, recovering from illness, supporting a family member). The goal is not perfect balance — it's *intentional imbalance.*

Ask yourself:
- **Am I choosing this focus, or is it choosing me?**
- **How long can I sustain this imbalance before something breaks?**
- **What's the minimum viable score in the neglected areas to avoid collapse?**

---

## Quarterly Check-In

Every 90 days, revisit this framework:

1. Re-rate yourself in all six dimensions
2. Compare to last quarter — what improved? What declined?
3. Celebrate progress, even small wins
4. Adjust your priorities for the next quarter

---

## Key Insights

After filling this out, reflect:

1. **What surprised me?**
   [Did you rate yourself higher or lower than expected in any area?]

2. **Where am I lying to myself?**
   [Where did you inflate or deflate your rating to avoid discomfort?]

3. **What's the biggest risk if I don't address the low areas?**
   [What happens if you keep neglecting relationships, health, or fun?]

4. **What's one dimension I've been avoiding, and why?**
   [Be honest.]

---

## How to Use This Framework

- **Quarterly reviews:** Update your ratings and priorities every 90 days
- **Annual reviews:** Look at the year-over-year trends — are you improving in the areas that matter?
- **Decision filter:** When considering a new opportunity, ask: "Which dimension does this serve? Which does it hurt?"

This is not about perfection. It's about awareness and intention.
