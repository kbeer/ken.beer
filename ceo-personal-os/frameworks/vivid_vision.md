# Vivid Vision Framework

**Inspired by Tony Robbins and Cameron Herold's approach to designing your future in sensory detail.**

Most goals are abstract. "Grow the company." "Be healthier." "Find balance." These don't pull you forward because you can't see them, feel them, or believe them.

A Vivid Vision is different. It's a detailed, sensory-rich description of your life 3–5 years from now, written as if it's already happening. It's specific enough to feel real and compelling enough to guide decisions.

---

## How to Use This Framework

1. Pick a time horizon: 3 years or 5 years (not 10 — too abstract)
2. Imagine you've already arrived at that future
3. Describe what you see, hear, feel, and experience in that future life
4. Write in present tense, first person, as if it's happening now
5. Be specific: names, numbers, places, sensations
6. Focus on what you want, not what you're avoiding

This takes 1–2 hours. Revisit annually and update as your vision clarifies.

### What I've Let Go Of

In this future, what are you *not* doing anymore? What have you intentionally walked away from?

- [Example: I'm no longer attending events I don't want to attend.]

  [How much time? What practices?]

### The Feeling

Close your eyes and imagine you're living this future right now.

**What does it feel like?**

[Describe the emotional and physical sensation of being in this life. Is it calm? Exciting? Grounded? Expansive? Use sensory language.]

---

## How to Use Your Vivid Vision

Once you've written this:

1. **Read it monthly.** Set a recurring reminder. Let it shape your decisions.
2. **Refine it.** As you learn more about what you want, update the details.
3. **Test decisions against it.** When choosing what to do next, ask: "Does this move me toward my Vivid Vision or away from it?"
4. **Share selectively.** If it helps, share parts of this with a coach, partner, or close advisor. But it's primarily for you.

This is not a business plan. It's a life plan. Treat it seriously.
