# Ideal Lifestyle Costing Framework

**Based on Tim Ferriss's concept from *The 4-Hour Workweek* and lifestyle design principles.**

Most people don't know what their ideal life actually costs. They assume it's unaffordable, so they don't design it. Or they chase a vague sense of "more," which has no finish line.

This framework helps you calculate the monthly cost of your ideal lifestyle — not a fantasy, but the real life you'd be thrilled to live. Once you know the number, you can design a path to fund it without guessing.

---

## How to Use This Framework

1. Define your ideal lifestyle in concrete terms (what, where, with whom)
2. Research the actual costs for each component
3. Calculate the total monthly and annual cost
4. Compare it to your current income
5. Identify the gap (if any) and design a plan to close it

This exercise takes 1–3 hours. Revisit annually or when your priorities shift.

## Part 2: Calculate the Costs

Now put real numbers to each category. Be honest. Don't lowball to make it seem achievable, and don't inflate to justify staying stuck.

## Part 3: The Total

Add up all subtotals.

**Total Monthly Cost of Ideal Lifestyle:** $______

**Total Annual Cost:** $______ x 12 = $______

---

## Part 4: Reality Check

Now compare this to your current situation.

### Current Reality
- **Current monthly income (post-tax):** $______
- **Current monthly expenses:** $______
- **Gap between current income and ideal lifestyle cost:** $______

### Analysis

**Is your ideal lifestyle affordable now?**
- If yes: What's stopping you from living it?
- If no: What's the gap, and how could you close it?

**What assumptions did you make?**
- Did you inflate costs out of fear?
- Did you deflate them to make it seem easier?

**What surprised you?**
- Was it cheaper than you thought?
- More expensive?
- Different priorities than you expected?

## Part 5: Design the Path

If there's a gap between your current income and your ideal lifestyle cost, design a plan.

### Option 1: Reduce the Cost
What could you adjust without sacrificing what truly matters?
- [Example: Live in a lower-cost city with the same quality of life]
- [Example: Travel less frequently but for longer durations]

### Option 2: Increase Income
How could you generate the additional income needed?
- [Example: Raise rates, add a new service, grow the business to a specific revenue target]
- [Example: Build a small secondary income stream]

### Option 3: Hybrid
What combination of cost reduction and income increase makes sense?

## Part 6: The Timeline

## Key Insights

After completing this exercise, answer:

1. **What did I learn?**
   [Was your ideal life more or less expensive than you thought? What matters most?]

2. **What can I start living now?**
   [What parts of your ideal lifestyle are already affordable or free?]

3. **What's one decision I can make this month to move closer?**
   [Be specific.]

## How to Use This

- **Revisit annually.** Your ideal lifestyle will evolve.
- **Use it to evaluate opportunities.** When considering a new role, deal, or project, ask: "Does this move me toward funding my ideal lifestyle, or away from it?"
- **Don't confuse lifestyle with luxury.** The goal is not excess — it's sufficiency plus joy.
