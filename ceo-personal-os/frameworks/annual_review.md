# Annual Review Framework

**Based on Dr. Anthony Gustin's approach to structured yearly reflection.**

This framework helps you close one year and open the next with clarity. It's designed to surface patterns, celebrate wins you might have forgotten, and identify what to do differently.

Use this once a year, ideally in late December or early January. Budget 2–4 hours of uninterrupted time.

---

## How to Use This Framework

1. Block a half-day on your calendar
2. Find a quiet place with no interruptions
3. Open last year's goals, calendar, and notes (if available)
4. Work through each section below — write freely, don't edit as you go
5. Synthesize your insights at the end
6. Use the output to inform your next year's goals

## Part 1: What Happened (The Facts)

Start with the data. What actually occurred this year?

### Major Events
List the 10–15 most significant events of your year — both professional and personal. Include launches, hires, deals closed, relationships started or ended, health changes, trips, losses, wins.

1.
2.
3.
(continue to 10–15)

### Roles and Identity
What roles did you play this year? (CEO, parent, partner, board member, athlete, friend, etc.)

- Which roles took the most energy?
- Which roles felt most aligned with who you want to be?
- Which roles did you neglect or avoid?

## Part 2: What Went Well (Celebrate First)

Before analyzing what went wrong, acknowledge what went right. This is not bragging — it's building self-trust.

### Wins
What are you genuinely proud of? Include things no one else would know about — quiet wins, character moments, avoided disasters.

Now the harder part. What do you wish had gone differently?

### Mistakes and Failures
What did you try that didn't work? Be specific. What did you learn?

### Energy Drains

## Part 4: Patterns and Insights

Step back. Look at your answers above. What patterns emerge?

### Recurring Themes
What goals, struggles, or desires showed up multiple years in a row?

### Strengths
What did you do well every time it mattered?

### Blind Spots
What did you consistently miss, misjudge, or underestimate?

### What You Learned About Yourself
Complete this sentence 3–5 times:
"This year I learned that I..."

## Part 5: The Filter Question

**If this year repeated ten times in a row, would you be satisfied with your life?**

- If no: What must change? Be specific.
