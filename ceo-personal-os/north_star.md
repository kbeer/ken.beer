# North Star

Your long-term direction. The thing that, if you moved toward it every year, would make the whole journey worth it.

This is not a mission statement. This is not a vision deck. This is a private, honest answer to the question: **What am I building toward?**

## Instructions

Fill out the sections below. Come back every 6–12 months and update them. Your North Star can shift — that's not failure, that's learning.

## What I'm Building (10-Year Horizon)

In ten years, what do you want to have built? Not what sounds impressive — what actually matters to you.

- **In my work:**
  [Describe the company, role, impact, or body of work you want to have created. Be specific.]

- **In my life:**
  [Describe the relationships, health, freedom, or experiences you want to have shaped.]

- **In my capacity:**
  [Describe the person you want to have become — skills, wisdom, reputation, character.]

---

## What Success Feels Like

Forget metrics for a moment. In ten years, if things went well, what does a normal Tuesday feel like?

- Where are you?
- Who are you with?
- What are you working on?
- How do you feel at the end of the day?

[Write 3–5 sentences describing a successful ordinary day in your future life.]

---

## What I'm Walking Away From

Building something often means un-building something else. What are you deliberately leaving behind?

- **Professionally:**
  [What roles, industries, or ways of working are you moving away from?]

- **Personally:**
  [What habits, relationships, or identities are you outgrowing?]

---

## Non-Negotiables

What must be true, no matter what? These are the boundaries that protect your North Star.

1. [Example: I will not sacrifice my health for short-term growth.]
2. [Example: I will not build something I wouldn't use myself.]
3. [Add 3–5 non-negotiables.]

---

## The Regret Minimization Test

Imagine you're 80 years old, looking back. Which decisions would you regret not making?

- **Career/Impact:**
  [What bold move or big bet would you regret not taking?]

- **Relationships/Life:**
  [What person, experience, or commitment would you regret not prioritizing?]

## Why This Matters to Me

Why does this direction matter? Not why it's smart or lucrative — why it's yours.

[Write 2–3 paragraphs. Be honest. No one else will read this.]

---

## Guiding Questions (Review These Quarterly)

When making decisions, ask:
1. Does this move me toward my North Star, or just look like progress?
2. Will I regret not doing this in ten years?
3. Does this align with my non-negotiables?
4. Am I building what I want, or what I think I should want?

## Notes

Your North Star is not a contract. It's a compass. Use it to orient, not to constrain. If it changes, update this document and move forward.

The point is not to predict the future. The point is to be intentional about the direction you're walking.
