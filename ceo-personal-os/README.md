# CEO Personal Operating System

A private, single-user system for reflection, clarity, and intentional leadership.

This is not productivity theater. This is not software. This is a system for thinking clearly about what matters, making deliberate choices, and staying aligned with who you want to become.

---

## What This Is

A personal operating system for CEOs, founders, and operators who want:
- **Clarity** without overwhelm
- **Accountability** without judgment
- **Reflection** without therapy speak
- **Direction** without bureaucracy

This system helps you run daily check-ins, weekly reviews, quarterly goal assessments, and annual reflections — all in plain text, using thoughtful prompts and proven frameworks.

---

## How to Use This System

### First-Time Setup (15 minutes)

1. **Read `principles.md`** — Understand the operating philosophy
2. **Complete `north_star.md`** — Define your long-term direction
3. **Fill out one framework** — Start with `frameworks/life_map.md`
4. **Run your first daily check-in** — Copy `reviews/daily/template.md` and answer the questions
5. **Optional: Upload past reviews** — Drop old annual reviews or notes into `uploads/` for pattern extraction

That's it. You're running.

### Daily Practice (5 minutes)

Every evening or morning:
1. Copy `reviews/daily/template.md` to `reviews/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Answer the five questions
3. Save and close

The daily check-in tracks energy, wins, friction, what to let go, and tomorrow's priority. It takes less time than scrolling LinkedIn.

### Weekly Practice (20 minutes)

Every Friday or Sunday:
1. Copy `reviews/weekly/template.md` to `reviews/weekly/YYYY-Www.md` (e.g., `2025-W01.md`)
2. Review your daily check-ins from the week
3. Answer the weekly reflection questions
4. Identify one strategic insight and one adjustment

The weekly review separates signal from noise and keeps you aligned.

### Quarterly Practice (90 minutes)

Every 13 weeks:
1. Copy `reviews/quarterly/template.md` to `reviews/quarterly/YYYY-Qn.md` (e.g., `2025-Q1.md`)
2. Review your weekly summaries
3. Assess goal progress against `goals/1_year.md`
4. Detect misalignment, analyze energy vs output, and course-correct

The quarterly review ensures you're building what you said you'd build.

### Annual Practice (half day)

Every December or January:
1. Copy `reviews/annual/template.md` to `reviews/annual/YYYY.md`
2. Work through the full Gustin-style annual review
3. Update your Life Map, Vivid Vision, and Ideal Life Costing
4. Complete the self-interviews in `interviews/`
5. Set goals for the next 1, 3, and 10 years

The annual review creates a narrative of your past year and clear intent for the next.

## Customization

This system uses placeholders like `[YOUR COMPANY]`, `[YOUR ROLE]`, and `[YOUR STAGE OF LIFE]`. Replace them with your actual context as you work through the templates.

You can adapt any prompt, remove frameworks that don't resonate, or add your own questions. This is your system — edit freely.

---

## Philosophy

This system assumes:
- You are capable of self-reflection without external validation
- Clarity comes from writing, not dashboards
- The best accountability is to your future self
- Time spent thinking is not time wasted
- You don't need more tools — you need better questions

---

## Credits

This system integrates frameworks from:
- **Dr. Anthony Gustin** — Annual Review framework
- **Tim Ferriss** — Ideal Lifestyle Costing
- **Tony Robbins** — Vivid Vision thinking
- **Alex Lieberman** — Life Map (career, relationships, health, meaning, finances, fun)

All frameworks are adapted and explained in plain language. This is not a copy — it's a thoughtful synthesis designed for a single user: you.

## What Success Looks Like

After three months using this system, you should:
- Know exactly what moved the needle and what didn't
- Have a clear narrative of your year, not scattered memories
- Make fewer reactive decisions
- Feel less guilty about what you didn't do
- Trust yourself more

This system creates clarity, not overwhelm.

Start with one daily check-in. Everything else follows.
