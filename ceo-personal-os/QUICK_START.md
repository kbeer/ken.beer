# Quick Start Guide

**Time to first use:** 15 minutes

---

## Option 1: Start Small (Recommended)

If you want to start using this system today without reading everything:

### 1. Run Your First Daily Check-In (5 minutes)

```bash
cp reviews/daily/template.md reviews/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

Open `reviews/daily/[TODAY].md` and answer the five questions. That's it.

Do this every day for a week. See how it feels.

---

### 2. Do a Weekly Review (20 minutes)

At the end of your first week:

```bash
cp reviews/weekly/template.md reviews/weekly/$(date +%Y-W%V).md
```

Open the file and answer the questions. Look back at your daily check-ins for patterns.

---

### 3. Set One Goal (10 minutes)

Open `goals/1_year.md` and fill out just one goal — your top priority for this year.

Skip the rest. You can add more later.

---

## Option 2: Full Setup (If You Have Time)

If you want to set up the full system:

### 1. Read the Core Documents (30 minutes)

- `README.md` — How the system works
- `principles.md` — The operating philosophy
- `north_star.md` — Fill this out to define your long-term direction

---

### 2. Complete One Framework (30 minutes)

Choose the framework that resonates most:

- `frameworks/life_map.md` — Assess balance across six life dimensions
- `frameworks/ideal_life_costing.md` — Calculate what your ideal life costs
- `frameworks/vivid_vision.md` — Design your future in vivid detail
- `frameworks/annual_review.md` — Reflect on the past year

Start with Life Map — it's the fastest and most useful for ongoing reviews.

---

### 3. Set Your 1-Year Goals (30 minutes)

Open `goals/1_year.md` and set 3–5 goals for this year. Be specific.

---

### 4. Start Your Daily Practice (5 minutes/day)

Copy `reviews/daily/template.md` and answer the questions every evening.

---

## Option 3: Deep Dive (Annual Review Season)

If it's December or January and you want to do a full year-end reflection:

### 1. Block a Half-Day (3–4 hours)

Find a quiet place. No interruptions.

---

### 2. Complete the Annual Review

Work through `reviews/annual/template.md` and `frameworks/annual_review.md`.

This is deep work. Take your time.

---

### 3. Complete the Self-Interviews

- `interviews/past_year_reflection.md`
- `interviews/identity_and_values.md`
- `interviews/future_self_interview.md`

---

### 4. Set Goals for Next Year

Fill out:
- `goals/1_year.md`
- `goals/3_year.md`
- `goals/10_year.md`

---

### 5. Update Memory

Add key insights, patterns, and lessons to `memory.md`.

---

## What to Do Next

Once you've started:

- **Daily:** 5-minute check-in
- **Weekly:** 20-minute review
- **Quarterly:** 90-minute deep review
- **Annually:** Half-day reflection and planning

The system compounds. The more you use it, the more valuable it becomes.

---

## Still Overwhelmed?

Start with one daily check-in. Just one.

Everything else can wait.

The point is not to have a perfect system. The point is to think clearly about what matters.

Start anywhere. Adjust as you go.
