# Past Annual Reviews

## Purpose

This folder is for storing past annual reviews, performance reviews, or year-end reflections from previous years.

## Why This Matters

Uploading past reviews allows you to:
- **Extract patterns** — See what goals, struggles, or themes recur year after year
- **Identify blind spots** — Notice what you consistently miss or misjudge
- **Track growth** — See how you've changed (or haven't) over time
- **Inform future goals** — Use past data to set better goals going forward

## What to Upload

Drop any of the following files here:
- Personal annual reviews
- Performance reviews (self-assessments or from employers/boards)
- Year-end reflections or journals
- Goal-setting documents from past years

Accepted formats: `.md`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`

## How to Use This

1. Upload your past reviews to this folder
2. Read through them and extract key insights
3. Add recurring patterns, lessons, or themes to `memory.md`
4. Reference these insights when setting new goals or making decisions

## Privacy
