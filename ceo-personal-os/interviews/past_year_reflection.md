# Past Year Reflection Interview

This is a guided conversation with yourself about the year that just ended. Treat it like sitting down with a thoughtful coach who asks good questions and listens without judgment.

Set aside 60–90 minutes. Write freely. Don't edit as you go. No one else will read this.

## Opening

Take a breath. Think back to where you were one year ago.

**Where were you physically?**
[Location, environment, context.]

**What were you working on?**
[Projects, role, focus.]

[Hopeful? Stressed? Excited? Burned out?]

Now, bring yourself to today.

**How do you feel now, looking back on the year?**
[Write whatever comes up first.]
