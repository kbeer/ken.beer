# Identity and Values Interview

This interview helps you clarify who you are and what you stand for — not who you think you should be, but who you actually are when the performance stops.

Use this once a year, or whenever you feel disconnected from yourself.

Set aside 60–90 minutes. Write honestly. This is private.

---

## Opening

Let's start with a simple question.

### Who are you?

Not your title, not your company, not your role. Who are you?

[Write 3–5 sentences. Start with "I am..." and see what comes out.]

---

### If someone who loves you described you in three words, what would they say?

[Write the three words. Why those?]

---

### If someone who frustrates you described you in three words, what would they say?

[Write the three words. Is there truth in it?]

---

## Your Values

Values are not aspirations. They're the principles you actually live by, whether you articulate them or not.

### What do you care about most?

Not what you *should* care about — what do you actually prioritize, defend, or sacrifice for?

[List 3–5 things. Be honest.]

---

### When have you felt most like yourself?

Describe 2–3 moments in your life when you felt fully aligned — where who you were and what you were doing matched perfectly.

[Write about each moment. What made it feel right?]

---

### When have you felt most out of integrity?

Describe 1–2 moments when you acted against your values — when you did something that didn't feel like you.

[What happened? Why? What did it cost you?]

---

### What do you refuse to compromise on?

What are your non-negotiables — the lines you won't cross, no matter the reward?

[List 3–5 boundaries.]

---

### What would you stand up for, even if it cost you something?

What principle, person, or cause matters enough that you'd take a loss to defend it?

[Write 2–3 examples.]

---

## Identity and Roles

You play many roles. Some fit. Some don't.

### What roles do you currently play?

[Example: CEO, parent, partner, board member, friend, athlete, creator, etc.]

List all the roles you hold:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
(continue as needed)

---

### Which roles feel most aligned with who you are?

Which ones energize you? Which feel natural?

[Write 2–3 roles and why they fit.]

---

### Which roles feel like performance?

Which ones drain you? Which feel like wearing a costume?

[Write 1–2 roles and why they feel off.]

---

### If you could let go of one role with no consequences, which would it be?

[Name it. Why? What would open up if you released it?]

---

## What You're Good At (And What You're Not)

Let's talk about your strengths and limitations without pretense.

### What are you genuinely great at?

Not what your resume says — what do you do better than most people, almost effortlessly?

[List 3–5 strengths.]

---

### What do people consistently come to you for?

What do people ask you for help with, advice on, or trust you to handle?

[List 2–3 things.]

---

### What are you not good at, and never will be?

What have you tried to improve and realized it's just not your zone?

[List 2–3 things. This is not failure — it's self-knowledge.]

---

### What do you pretend to be good at, but aren't?

Where are you performing competence instead of admitting limitation?

[Be honest. What's the cost of that pretense?]

---

## What You Want (Deep Down)

Forget what sounds impressive. What do you actually want?

### If no one was watching, what would you do with your life?

[Describe it. What would you build, create, or experience?]

---

### What do you want to be known for?

Not what would look good on a resume — what do you want people to say about you when you're not in the room?

[Write 2–3 sentences.]

---

### What do you want to feel more of?

[Joy? Peace? Aliveness? Connection? Freedom? Challenge?]

[Name 2–3 feelings and why they matter.]

---

### What do you want to feel less of?

[Stress? Guilt? Resentment? Boredom? Pressure?]

[Name 2–3 feelings and what's causing them.]

---

## Your Edges and Growth

Where are you growing, and where are you stuck?

### What are you currently learning about yourself?

[What new insight or pattern are you noticing?]

---

### What fear do you keep bumping into?

What recurring fear shows up when you're about to do something important?

[Name it. Where does it come from?]

---

### What would you do if you weren't afraid?

[Be specific. What bold move, hard conversation, or big bet are you avoiding?]

---

### What part of yourself are you ready to outgrow?

What old identity, habit, or story are you ready to leave behind?

[Describe it. Why now?]

---

## Your People

Your values show up in who you choose to be around.

### Who are the 3–5 people you trust most?

[Name them. Why them?]

---

### Who brings out the best in you?

[Name 1–2 people. What do they see in you that others don't?]

---

### Who drains you, and why are they still in your life?

[Be honest. What's keeping you from creating distance?]

---

### If you could build a "personal board of directors," who would be on it?

Who would you want advising you on life, work, and key decisions?

[List 3–5 people, real or hypothetical. What does each bring?]

---

## Closing Reflection

You've spent time clarifying who you are. Now distill it.

### If you had to describe your core identity in one sentence, what would it be?

"I am someone who..."

[Write it here.]

---

### What's one value you want to live more fully this year?

[Name it. What would change if you did?]

---

### What's one part of yourself you want to honor more?

[A strength you've been hiding? A need you've been ignoring? A truth you've been avoiding?]

[Write it here.]

## Next Steps

After completing this interview:
1. Update `north_star.md` with any new clarity about your direction
2. Revisit `principles.md` — do your operating principles reflect your actual values?
3. Save this interview as `interviews/identity_and_values_[YEAR].md`

This is deep work. If it surfaced something important, sit with it. Let it inform your decisions.
