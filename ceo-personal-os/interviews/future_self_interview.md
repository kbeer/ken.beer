# Future Self Interview

This is a conversation with the person you're becoming. You'll imagine yourself 3–5 years in the future and interview that version of you about how they got there.

This exercise helps clarify what you actually want, what trade-offs you're willing to make, and what path feels right.

Set aside 45–60 minutes. Write in present tense, as if you're already there.

## Setup

**Choose your time horizon:**
- [ ] 3 years from now
- [ ] 5 years from now

**Today's date:** [Current date]
**Future date:** [3 or 5 years from now]

Now, close your eyes for a moment. Imagine you've arrived at that future date. Things have gone well. Not perfect, but well. You're living a life you're proud of.

**Where are you?** [Physically — what city, what space?]
**How do you feel?** [In your body, in your energy.]

Now, interview that future version of yourself.
