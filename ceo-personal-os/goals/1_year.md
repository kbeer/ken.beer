# 1-Year Goals

**Year:** [YEAR]
**Last updated:** [Date]

## Purpose

This document defines what you're building toward in the next 12 months. These are not wish-list items — they're commitments.

Good 1-year goals are:
- **Specific** — You'll know when you've hit them
- **Meaningful** — They move you toward your North Star
- **Achievable** — Ambitious but grounded in reality
- **Yours** — Not borrowed from someone else's playbook

Review this quarterly. Update as needed. Goals can shift — that's not failure, that's learning.

## Final Note

Goals are not a contract. They're a compass. If you learn something this year that changes your direction, change your goals. Clarity beats consistency.

What matters is not perfection — it's intentionality.
