**Target year:** [YEAR, 10 years from now]

## Purpose

Ten years is long enough to become a different person and build a completely different life. This is not a detailed plan — it's a directional stake in the ground.

Use this document to define what you want your life to look like a decade from now. Don't worry about "how." Focus on "what" and "why."

Revisit every 1–2 years. Your 10-year vision will evolve — that's growth, not failure.

## The Big Question

**In ten years, what do you want to have built?**

Not what sounds impressive. Not what you think you *should* build. What actually matters to you?

[Write 2–3 paragraphs. Be honest.]

## Reflection Prompts (Review Every 1–2 Years)

When you revisit this document, answer:

1. **Does this vision still feel true?**
   [Has your direction shifted? Update if needed.]

2. **Am I moving toward this vision, or away from it?**
   [What decisions in the last year moved you closer? What pulled you off course?]

3. **What do I need to start, stop, or change to stay on track?**
   [Be specific.]

## Final Note

Ten years is a long time. You'll change. The world will change. This vision will evolve.

The goal is not to lock yourself into a rigid plan. The goal is to have a direction — something to orient toward, something to guide your decisions.

Use this vision as a compass, not a contract.

And remember: the best way to predict your future is to create it, intentionally, one decision at a time.
